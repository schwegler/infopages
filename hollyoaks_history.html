    <!-- Chosen Palette: Modern Vibrant (Primary: Fuchsia, Secondary: Teal, Accent: Orange, Background: Light Grey/White) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page, scrollable application with distinct, animated sections. A prominent Hero section introduces the app with key statistics. This leads into a dedicated section for the Thematic Evolution Chart. The Family Explorer section follows, presenting each family tree in a modern card layout, with interactive character nodes triggering an animated, Material Design-inspired modal for details. Finally, the Timeline Explorer section displays events grouped by year, with subtle scroll-in animations for each event card and a prominent year filter. This structure prioritizes dynamic content reveal and a fluid, engaging user experience. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Family Trees (Goal: Organize/Relationships) -> Interactive HTML/CSS Diagram. Enhanced nodes with hover effects and a sleek modal for character details, including links to timeline events. 2. Storyline Evolution (Goal: Show Change) -> Chart.js Bar Chart. Custom colors for a modern look, responsive, and clear labels. 3. Timeline (Goal: Inform/Compare) -> Scrollable, Grouped List with Filter. Each year header and event card will have subtle fade-in/slide-up animations on scroll. Color-coded borders for family relevance. All elements are designed for dynamic interaction and visual appeal. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
